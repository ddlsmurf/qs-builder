Data in this folder is generated by running the following from the repo's root:

`$ tools/get.sh`

This should get:

* `data/repo_locations.txt` from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/938822/) (Courtesy of github:HenningJ)
* `data/plugin_reference.txt` from [the wiki](http://qsapp.com/wiki/Plugin_Reference), as well as any linked pages
** `wikitable_name_to_id.yaml` I fiddled this so much I'm including it. It's a mapping from the name in the wiki to the bundle id.

Additionals:

* `blacktr_qsplugin.sql` and `blacktr_qsplugin2.sql` from the original blacktree source (for legacy data)
